# micro:bit Coding Examples

This repository can be used for anyone with a micro:bit, in a coding workshop for kids or on your own using the online [micro:bit editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/). All the examples can be found on the [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/code/) web site. Each folder includes a different example with a Javascript file as well as a .hex file. To run the code on your micro:bit simply copy the .hex file onto your micro:bit while it is plugged into your computer.

The projects in this repo are as follows:

- [Compass](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/compass)
- [Dice](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/dice)
- [Fireflies](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/fireflies)
- [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/rock-paper-scissors)
- [Smiley Button](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/smiley-buttons)
- [Snap the Dot](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/snap-the-dot)

You can import the .hex file directly in the [micro:bit editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/) to see the code as blocks or Javascript. Once you have the code imported feel free to modify it as you wish!

Happy coding :)
